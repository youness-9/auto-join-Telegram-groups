# auto-join-Telegram-groups
Telegram groups are the best place to learn anything. That's why I created this script.
This script is a program used to join Telegram groups and conveniently obtain the links to these groups. It can be used to search for specific groups and join them or to retrieve the links of the groups within your account.

# command to run script
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 telegram_group.py
```
